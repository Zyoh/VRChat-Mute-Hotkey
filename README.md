# VRChat Mute Hotkey
A global mute hotkey for VRChat using OSC

# Usage

**Make sure to disable TOGGLE VOICE in-game!**

The app comes with defaults set up with `F8` to toggle voice. To change the hotkey, run the app with the `--hotkey` argument followed by the name of the key you want to use. Ex. `--hotkey F10`

This will occasionally cause the default in-game keybind `V` to stop working. This can be fixed by disabling and enabling OSC in-game.
